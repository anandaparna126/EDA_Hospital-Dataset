# Hospital Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python

## Introduction
This repository contains Python code and data files for conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a hospital dataset sourced from Kaggle. The purpose of this analysis is to gain insights into the data, understand its structure, identify patterns, and prepare it for further analysis or modeling.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about hospital records. The dataset includes various attributes such as patient demographics, medical conditions, treatment details, and more.

## Files
- `hospital_data.csv`: This CSV file contains the hospital dataset that will be used for the analysis.
- `hospital_eda.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file containing the Python code for performing EDA on the hospital dataset.

## Requirements
To run the code provided in the Jupyter Notebook, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Download the dataset (`hospital_data.csv`) from the provided Kaggle link.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Open `hospital_eda.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and perform EDA on the dataset.
5. Analyze the outputs, visualizations, and insights obtained from the EDA.
